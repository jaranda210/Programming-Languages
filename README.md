# Programming-Languages
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project aimed to create an object-oriented programming (OOP) application in C++ to simulate two clocks displaying simultaneously in 12-hour and 24-hour formats.  Users can interact with the program by adding hours, minutes, or seconds to both clocks.
# What did you do particularly well?
I created the code in a well-structured and modularized format, adhering to OOP principles.  Also, proper input validation ensures that only valid time values are accepted.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Error handling could be improved to handle unexpected user inputs more gracefully.  Another way I could enhance code is by adding input validation for user menu choices to prevent non-numeric inputs.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Writing the logic for adding hours, minutes, and seconds while ensuring the time remains within valid ranges posed a challenge.  This was overcome by carefully designing the logic within the Clock class and implementing appropriate checks in the addHour(), addMinute(), and addSecond() functions.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Understanding how to structure and implement OOP applications in C++ is highly transferable to other projects.  Improving problem-solving skills, especially when dealing with time-related operations and user input validation, will also carry over.  
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
First, the code is maintainable due to its modular structure, allowing for easy modification and expansion of functionality in the future.  Secondly, comments and descriptive function names make the code readable, enabling others to understand and modify it.  Finally, by encapsulating clock-related operations within the Clock class, the program becomes adaptable to potential changes or enhancements, such as adding new time-related features or implementing different clock formats.
